Hello this is my blog! I'm an anonymous blogger and I'll write about what I study every day or what I do every day. I'm currently majoring mathematics and my interests are mathematics, theoretical physics, and computer science. <br/> If you have questions about any posts, you can contact me on discord:land of langs#3646 or on instagram:land.of.langs

Let $(A, I, \gamma)$ be a divided power ring.
Let $A \to B$ be a ring map. Let $J \subset B$ be an ideal
with $IB \subset J$. There exists a homomorphism of
divided power rings
$$
(A, I, \gamma) \longrightarrow (D, \bar J, \bar \gamma)
$$
such that
$$
\Hom_{(A, I, \gamma)}((D, \bar J, \bar \gamma), (C, K, \delta)) =
\Hom_{(A, I)}((B, J), (C, K))
$$
