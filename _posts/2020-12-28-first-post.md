Hello this is my blog! I'm an anonymous blogger and I'll write about what I study every day or what I do every day. I'm currently majoring mathematics and my interests are mathematics, theoretical physics, and computer science. <br/> If you have questions about any posts, you can contact me on discord:land of langs#3646 or on instagram:land.of.langs
